Saturday morning. The sun has broken free of the morning haze.  Birds flit, twittering, between branches.
 My kids are out in the garden, laughing as they play.

One of them comes running over and asks _me_ to play.  No.

Off he goes.

A moment later he's back. Come on, will I play? Nope. 

He frowns and back he goes to his game, which as far as I can tell involves kicking a football as
high as he can in the air, falling over, and then giggling.  And then getting up and doing it again.

Two minutes later and something nudges my arm. _Why_ won't I play?

"Well," I say,

## File naming

Haven't you read the comments on file naming I made in [part 1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url
2019-05-01-Me_versus_the_European_Genome_Phenome_Archive %}) and [part 2]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url
2019-05-02-Me_versus_the_European_Genome_Phenome_Archive_part_two %})? The reason I can't play football with
you is that on Thursday I discovered one of my files was wrongly named on the EGA FTP site, and
that wasted 24 hours, and then yesterday I decided one of the files should be named slightly more
consistently with another file, and that wasted another 24 hours, and if I don't get this done by
Monday then I shan't be able to do all the other things I have to do next week, and if I don't do
it today then I shan't be able to play with you tomorrow either. So, [what I'm doing now is]({{
site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-05-12-Me_versus_the_European_Genome_Phenome_Archive_part_three %}),

(He goes back to his game.)
